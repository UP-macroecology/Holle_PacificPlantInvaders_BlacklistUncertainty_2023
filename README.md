# Holle_PacificPlantInvaders_BlacklistUncertainty_2023/24

Blacklisting potential Pacific plant invaders using species distribution models - uncertainties through species and environmental inputs


## Workflow

The analysis is based on an initial subset of known naturalized plant populations of 122 plant species occurring on at least one of the Hawaiian Islands, derived from the compiled dataset by [Wohlwend et al. (2021)](#2). For these species, all available occurrence records were obtained from the [Global Biodiversity Information Facility](https://www.gbif.org/) (GBIF) and the [Botanical Information and Ecology Network](https://biendata.org/) (BIEN) in June 2023, which were first cleaned to remove duplicates and occurrence records with erroneous time stamps or coordinates and were fit to a 1 km resolution.

The biogeographical status of the cleaned occurrences was assigned based on the [World Checklist of Vascular Plants](#1) (WCVP), indicating whether the species record is a native or introduced occurrence. Data gaps were filled using two additional sources, the [Global Inventory of Floras and Traits](https://gift.uni-goettingen.de/home) (GIFT) and the [Global Naturalized Alien Flora](https://glonaf.org/) (GloNAF). Resulting contradictory information was dealt with using two subsequent criteria: If the conflicting sources referred to areas of different sizes, the status from the source referring to the smaller area is used. If this was not the case, all sources were weighted equally, leading to the status "contradictory" when conflicts in the status assignment occurred. Final status assignments designated species records as native, introduced, contradictory, or unknown. 

### 1 - Initial species selection
The initial species selection was based on cleaned and thinned native occurrence numbers using two criteria to ensure the consideration of two different niches:  A lower limit of 40 native presences per species as well as a minimum difference of 40 between native and global occurrences. Additionally, species were excluded when having native assignments on the Hawaiian Islands. The spatial thinning of the occurrences pursued to avoid spatial autocorrelation using a thinning distance of 3 km. 

### 2 - Background data generation and thinning
For the selected study species, background data was derived. This was done by a random selection of points excluding the presence locations within a buffer distance of 200 km using a presence-absence ratio of 1:10. Spatial thinning was repeated for the generated background data using the same thinning distance of 3 km. As a last step for species data preparation, the sampled thinned background data was merged with the cleaned and thinned presence data. This described species processing steps were separately carried out based on native and global occurrences.

### 3 - Relation of environmental data to occurrence data
For each study species, the occurrence information was related to the environmental data. Environmental data comprised 15 climatic variables (CHELSA, version 2), and 14 edaphic variables (SoilGrids) at a resolution of 1 km. These environmental data were related in a way that each of the two distribution datasets (based on native and global occurrences) was separately related to purely climatic and combined climatic and edaphic predictor types. As output, four differently combined datasets a joined distribution and environmental data were generated that acted as input for the SDMs. Based on the occurrence numbers of the four differently combined data sets of joined distribution and environmental data per species, the final species selection was made. Once again, a lower limit of 40 native presences and a minimum difference of 40 between native and global occurrences were applied as criteria. 

### 4 - Variable selection
For each of the four SDM input datasets, the four most important and weakly correlated variables based on the Boyce index were extracted from the ranked predictor output that were then considered in the upcoming model-building process. For the models that used both predictor types, the two climatic and edaphic variables that were ranked first in the predictor output were considered.

### 5 - SDM fitting and validation
Based on each of the four SDM input datasets, four different model algorithms were applied to fit the models: GLM, GAM, RF, and BRT. For each model, the performance was assessed using the 5-fold cross validation based on five different performance measures: The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), true skill statistic (TSS), sensitivity, specificity, and the Boyce index. Additionally, the ensemble performance of the four different models using the same niche in the input occurrence data and environmental data was assessed.

### 6 - Model predictions
For each species, predictions were made to the investigated Pacific island groups considering models fitted with the four different algorithms per SDM input data set. Moreover, an ensemble model was established by combining the continuous predictions of each algorithm using the arithmetic mean. The predicted occurrence probabilities were then converted into binary predictions, translating into predicted presences and absences. In a last step, the fraction of predicted suitable habitat in % per island group as well as Pacific-wide was quantified.

### 7 - Blacklist construction
Blacklists, reflecting the species with the highest Pacific-wide establishment potential, were constructed using three different approaches: The Pacific-wide fraction of predicted suitable habitat, the number of island groups with suitable habitats, and the mean rank over all island groups. This was done considering the predictions of the different predictor sets as well as the applied algorithms and their ensemble, resulting in 20 blacklists each based on unique information.
