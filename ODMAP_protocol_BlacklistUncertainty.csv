Overview,Hypotheses,Hypotheses,The species distributions are mainly determined by climate and soil.
Overview,Assumptions,Model assumptions,"We assumed that climate and soil are the key explanatory variables for species distributions, species are in equilibrium with environment, observation biases are insignificant."
Overview,Algorithms,Modelling techniques,glm; gam; randomForest; brt
Overview,Algorithms,Model complexity,We used an intermediate level of model complexity to prevent overfitting for species with smaller sample sizes and to ensure that predictions to new places remain robust.
Overview,Algorithms,Model averaging,We used the arithmetic mean to combine all four model algorithms into one ensemble.
Overview,Workflow,Model workflow,"We downloaded species data from GBIF and BIEN, cleaned the coordinates, and determined the biogeographical status of plant occurrences as either native or introduced based on three different sources: WCVP, GIFT,  and GIoNAF. We generated background data by randomly selecting points within a buffer distance of 200 km from the occurrence locations, using a presence-absence ratio of 1:10. To avoid spatial autocorrelation, we then thinned all presences and pseudo-absences using a 3 km threshold. We obtained climate data (CHELSA) and edaphic data (SoilGrids) at a 1 km resolution. Given that our study aimed to quantify the uncertainty in species input data and environmental input data for SDM-based blacklists, we intersected the two types of species data (native vs. global) with the two types of environmental data (climatic vs. edapho-climatic), resulting in four combinations of input data for each species. For each of these four SDM input datasets, we selected the four most important and weakly correlated predictor variables for model construction. SDMs were fitted using four statistical algorithms (GLM, GAM, RF, BRT). For the regression-based methods (GLM, GAM), we used a presence-absence ratio of 1:10 but applied equal weighting during model building. For the machine-learning methods, we used ten replicate sets of background data in a presence-absence ratio of 1:1, generating 10 different models which were then averaged. Additionally, model ensembles were constructed using the arithmetic mean of predictions over all four model algorithms.  The SDM performance was evaluated using a 5-fold cross-validation by computing AUC, TSS, sensitivity, specificity, and the Boyce index. Based on each model and their ensemble, we predicted potential presence and absence (using the maxSSS threshold) across the Pacific. Based on the quantified area of predicted suitable habitat in km², we separately constructed a blacklist for each combination of species input data, environmental input data and SDM algorithm, as well as a final blacklist with ensembles of SDM algorithms."
